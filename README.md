how many times by drivers and trucks of traffic infractions.  

4. DATA COLLECTION:
By CSV from Microsoft SQL database. 
It did a SQL query from ERP system company, that ERP are integarted with board computer of trucks to collecting data from GPS divece of truck getting temetry data,

5. DATA CLEANING:
This process it did usisng Python with jupyter notebook.
Check unfilled columns. 
Deleting some inconsistent rows. 
Translantion contents some columns to English.
Tranlation of columns label to English.
Deleting some inconsistent columns. 
Replace some characters.
Changing data types.

6. EXPLORATION OF DATA:
Understand what the data says, create hypothesis maps and hypothesis questions that generate insights for analysis

7. DATA MODELING:
Create a new standardized and normalized dataset with the insights seen in the data exploration phase, create new columns, 
categories or dimensions from the original dataset.

8. VIEWING AND REPORT:
Here you work the visualization / report of the analysed data, the concept of storytelling can be used if necessary.

9. CONCLUSION:
